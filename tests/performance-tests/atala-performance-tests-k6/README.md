## Prerequisites

- [k6](https://k6.io/docs/getting-started/installation)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) (optional)

## Installation

**Install dependencies**

Clone the generated repository on your local machine, move to the project root folder and install the dependencies defined in [`package.json`](./package.json)

```bash
$ yarn install
```

## Running the test

To run a test written in TypeScript, we first have to transpile the TypeScript code into JavaScript and bundle the project

```bash
$ yarn webpack
```

This command creates the final test files to the `./dist` folder.

Once that is done, we can run our script the same way we usually do, for instance:

```bash
$ k6 run dist/connection-flow-test.js
```
