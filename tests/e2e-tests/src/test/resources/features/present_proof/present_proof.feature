Feature: Present Proof Protocol

  @AIP20
  Scenario: Holder presents credential proof to verifier
    Given Faber and Bob have an existing connection
    And Bob has an issued credential from Acme
    When Faber sends a request for proof presentation to Bob
    And Bob makes the presentation of the proof to Faber
    And Faber acknowledges the proof
    Then Faber has the proof verified

  @skip
  Scenario: Accepting already accepted proof should fail
    Given Faber and Bob have an existing connection
    And Bob has an issued credential from Acme
    When Faber sends a request for proof presentation to Bob
    And Bob makes the presentation of the proof to Faber
    And Bob sends already sent proof
    Then Bob checks that the request failed
