Feature: Issue JWT credential

  Scenario Outline: Issuing jwt credential using <assertionMethod> assertion
    Given Issuer and Holder have an existing connection
    And Holder creates unpublished DID for 'JWT'
    When Issuer prepares a custom PRISM DID
    And Issuer has a published 'STUDENT_SCHEMA' schema
    And Issuer adds a '<assertionMethod>' key for 'assertionMethod' purpose with '<assertionName>' name to the custom PRISM DID
    And Issuer creates the custom PRISM DID
    And Issuer publishes DID to ledger
    When Issuer offers a jwt credential to Holder with 'short' form DID using issuingKid '<assertionName>' and STUDENT_SCHEMA schema
    And Holder receives the credential offer
    And Holder accepts jwt credential offer using 'auth-1' key id
    And Issuer issues the credential
    Then Holder receives the issued credential
    When Issuer revokes the credential issued to Holder
    Then Issuer should see the credential was revoked
    When Issuer sends a request for jwt proof presentation to Holder
    And Holder receives the presentation proof request
    And Holder makes the jwt presentation of the proof
    Then Issuer sees the proof returned verification failed
    Examples:
      | assertionMethod | assertionName |
      | secp256k1       | assert-1      |
      | ed25519         | assert-1      |

  Scenario: Issuing jwt credential with published PRISM DID and student schema
    Given Issuer and Holder have an existing connection
    And Issuer has a published DID for 'JWT'
    And Issuer has a published 'STUDENT_SCHEMA' schema
    And Holder has an unpublished DID for 'JWT'
    When Issuer offers a jwt credential to Holder with 'short' form using 'STUDENT_SCHEMA' schema
    And Holder receives the credential offer
    And Holder accepts jwt credential offer using 'auth-1' key id
    And Issuer issues the credential

    And Holder has an unpublished DID for 'JWT'
    When Issuer offers a jwt credential to Holder with 'short' form DID with wrong claims structure using 'STUDENT_SCHEMA' schema
    Then Issuer should see that credential issuance has failed

  Scenario: Issuing jwt credential with unpublished PRISM DID
    Given Issuer and Holder have an existing connection
    And Issuer has an unpublished DID for 'JWT'
    And Issuer has a published 'STUDENT_SCHEMA' schema
    And Holder has an unpublished DID for 'JWT'
    And Issuer offers a jwt credential to Holder with 'long' form DID
    And Holder receives the credential offer
    And Holder accepts jwt credential offer using 'auth-1' key id
    And Issuer issues the credential
    Then Holder receives the issued credential

  Scenario: Connectionless issuance of JWT credential using OOB invitation
    Given Issuer has a published DID for 'JWT'
    And Issuer has a published 'STUDENT_SCHEMA' schema
    And Holder has an unpublished DID for 'JWT'
    When Issuer creates a 'JWT' credential offer invitation with 'short' form DID and STUDENT_SCHEMA schema
    And Holder accepts the credential offer invitation from Issuer
    And Holder accepts jwt credential offer using 'auth-1' key id
