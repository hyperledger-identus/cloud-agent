    And Issuer adds a '<assertionMethod>' key for 'assertionMethod' purpose with '<assertionName>' name to the custom PRISM DID
    And Issuer adds a '<authentication>' key for 'authentication' purpose with '<authenticationName>' name to the custom PRISM DID
    And Issuer creates the custom PRISM DID
    And Issuer publishes DID to ledger

    When Issuer offers a sd-jwt credential to Holder
    And Holder receives the credential offer
    And Holder accepts credential offer for sd-jwt
    And Issuer issues the credential
    Then Holder receives the issued credential
    And Holder checks the sd-jwt credential contents
