**NOTE** - The `Mediator` development is part of the Mercury BB and is being implemented in a separate repository [atala-prism-mediator](https://github.com/input-output-hk/atala-prism-mediator).

**Folders:**

- `mercury-library`:
  Is our project implementation of the DID Comm and DID Comm protocols.

- `roots-id-mediator`:
  Contains a configuration setup and utilities script to test interoperability against ROOTS-ID's mediator.
