## Quick start

This is a sandbox project based on tapir template for Scala 3 and ZIO/ZIO-HTTP.

You can play there with different Tapir features or even run the in-memory schema service.

You can use the standard commands:

```shell
sbt compile # build the project
sbt test # run the tests
sbt run # run the application (Main)
```
