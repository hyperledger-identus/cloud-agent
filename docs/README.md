# Atala v2 Documentation

This is the landing page for the Atala v2 technical documentation set.  

## Architecture diagrams

The diagrams are based on the [C4 model](https://c4model.com) to describe the architecture at different levels of details:
1. ***Context***: provides a starting point, showing how the software system in scope fits into the world around it.
2. ***Containers***: zooms into the software system in scope, showing the high-level technical building blocks.
3. ***Components***: zooms into an individual container, showing the components inside it.
4. ***Code***: optional, can be used to zoom into an individual component, showing how that component is implemented.

We use the [Diagrams as code](https://diagrams-as-code.com) approach, coding using the [Structurizr DSL](https://structurizr.com).  

### Source files

Source code for the different diagrams can be found in the DSL files located [here](./architecture/structurizr).

### Visualisation

A visual and interactive representation of the diagrams can be rendered using [Structurizr Lite](https://structurizr.com/help/lite).  

The following [Dockerfile](./architecture/Dockerfile) is provided to create a custom Docker image of Structurizr Lite that embeds the Atala DSL files.  
To build the custom image, execute the following command from the repo's root folder:
```bash
docker build -t atala-structurizr-lite docs/architecture
```

## OpenAPI Specifications

### Source files
- The OpenAPI specification for a **service** building block is written in YAML format.
- Each building block is responsible for making its YAML spec available to other parties via HTTP GET on one of its service endpoints.

### Visualisation

[Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) is used and allows development teams and service consumers to visualize and interact with the APIâ€™s resources
without having any of the implementation logic in place. It is automatically generated from the OpenAPI specification.

Swagger UI is available as a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/swaggerapi/swagger-ui).

## Run locally with Docker Compose

The following [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) file can be used to run both services in one shot by executing the following command from the repo's root folder:

***!!! Make sure to build the custom Atala Structurizr Lite Docker image first as described above.***
```bash
docker-compose -f docs/docker-compose.yml up
```
