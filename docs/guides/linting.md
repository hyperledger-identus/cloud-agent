# Linting

Megalinter is used as the default linter and is run at the point of creating a PR by Github Actions. It is also included as a pre-commit hook.

## Configuration

The default configuration for megalinter is found at the root of the repository in `.mega-linter.yml`.

This configuration forms the base and additional properties are overridden in the Github Action workflow file `./github/workflows/lint.yml`.

The Github Action workflow file only impacts the configuration at the point it runs within the continuous integration (CI) environment.

This means that megalinter will behave differently when run locally as part of the pre-commit hook [or enacted manually] compared to when run in an automated way in Github Actions as part of CI.

**Linting is currently in an early adoption phase and due to adoption of Scala 3, it only runs in a mode which does not fail PR checks if errors are found for various linters.**

> At the end of this markdown document is a section for Linting feedback, please leave feedback in this section so that we can enable and refine the linting configuration over time

## Linting Feedback

Please add any feedback on the linting rules in the below table. This allows us to capture potential improvements on what what linters to enable/disable and refined configuration for each linter.

The objective with this feedback is to strike the balance of linting being useful for improving quality but not at the cost of developer velocity [it should not cause pain]

The initial configuration has been created by disabling linters which were previously disabled and then changing linters which seem incompatible with our current work to "Enabled but pas even with error"

Please use the following format

#### SCALA_SCALAFIX

Date Added: 2023-01-16

Author: David Poltorak

Date Actioned: 2023-01-16

Linter - Current Status: Enabled

Linter - Suggested Change: Disabled

*Change detail*

SCALA_SCALAFIX is not compatible with Scala3. The errors it reports cannot be fixed. Suggest that we disable this and rely on scalafmt only

---

#### MARKDOWN_MARKDOWN_LINK_CHECK

Date Added: 2023-01-16

Author: David Poltorak

Date Actioned: 2023-01-16

Linter - Current Status: Enabled

Linter - Suggested Change: Customise and Enabled but pass even with error

*Change detail*

MARKDOWN_MARKDOWN_LINK_CHECK detects lots of broken links in automatically generated files. Suggest change configuration to ignore `CHANGELOG.md` which don't conform to the rules.

MARKDOWN_MARKDOWN_LINK_CHECK cannot traverse links to websites which require authentication. This means that links to protected github pages fail checks. Suggest change to configuration to enable but pass even with error until repository is public.

#### PROTOBUF_PROTOLINT

Date Added: 2023-01-16

Author: David Poltorak

Date Actioned: 2023-01-16

Linter - Current Status: Enabled

Linter - Suggested Change: Enabled but pass even with error

*Change detail*

PROTOBUF_PROTOLINT generates lots of errors for files which are quite large and may block small changes to these files. Suggest change to enable but pass even with error to not block velocity. Suggest to re enabled when files can be reviewed as a specific task

---

#### OPENAPI_SPECTRAL

Date Added: 2023-01-16

Author: David Poltorak

Date Actioned: 2023-01-16

Linter - Current Status: Enabled

Linter - Suggested Change: Enabled but pass even with error

*Change detail*

OPENAPI_SPECTRAL generates lots of errors for files which are quite large and have been generated by the openapi generator which is going to be replaced with Tapir in future work. Suggest change to enable but pass even with error. Can be re enabled when files can be reviewed as a specific task / they get removed
