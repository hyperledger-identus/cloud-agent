# Tutorials

Welcome to the Atala PRISM Tutorials!

These tutorials will help you get started with using Atala PRISM.
The tutorials will guide you through setting up a connection, working with [Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)](https://github.com/input-output-hk/atala-prism-docs/blob/main/documentation/docs/concepts/glossary.md#decentralized-identifer), and using [verifiable credentials](https://github.com/input-output-hk/atala-prism-docs/blob/main/documentation/docs/concepts/glossary.md#verifiable-credentials).

Whether you are new to [self-sovereign identity (SSI)](https://github.com/input-output-hk/atala-prism-docs/blob/main/documentation/docs/concepts/glossary.md#self-sovereign-identity) or have prior experience, these tutorials will provide the necessary information and skills to build and use SSI-based applications.


Throughout all code examples in tutorials, the following conventions are in use:
* Issuer Agent is hosted at `http://localhost:8080/prism-agent/`
* Holder Agent is hosted at `http://localhost:8090/prism-agent/`
* Verifier Agent is hosted at `http://localhost:8100/prism-agent/`

:::info To use the PRISM Cloud Agents, you must include an `apiKey` header in your requests. You can configure the value of the key, so make sure to replace `{API_KEY}` with your key value in the CURL commands supplied throughout this tutorial. :::
